# Data Cleaning Study Case using Python
in this case we use Customer Satisfaction Survey as Dataset.

Data cleaning is a foundational process in the data science lifecycle, and its role cannot be overemphasized when trying to uncover insights and generate reliable answers. More often than not, data will always be dirty in the real world, and data cleaning cannot be completely avoided.

we use 9 steps to clean the dataset:  
STEP 1 : LOAD & INSPECT  
STEP 2 : CLEAN COLUMN NAMES  
STEP 3 : FIX DATA TYPES  
STEP 4: REMOVE DUPLICATES  
STEP 5: HANDLING OUTLIERS  
STEP 6: CLEAN STRINGS / TEXT DATA  
STEP 7: STANDARDIZE VALUES  
STEP 8: RENAME / DROP / REORDER COLUMNS  
STEP 9: HANDLE MISSING DATA  

The output of the file will be exported in csv or xls file
